    <h2>Leadership and Activies</h2>
    <h3>National Honors Society</h3>
    <p>
        NHS is an organization that creates enthusiasm for scholarship, stimulates desire to render service, promotes leadership and develops character in students.  As an active member, I participated in school and community service activities such as fundraisers and leadership, while maintaining required academic excellence. I ended with a weighted GPA of 4.15.

    <h3>Highland High School Speech and Debate</h3>
    <p>I was introduced to Highland High School’s speech and debate team qualifying to Speech and Debate Nationals as a novice in my junior year and again in 2 categories as a senior.  My success has taught me numerous life lessons which have helped me to improve on a personal level, as well as on an academic level. The leadership abilities and attributes that participation has given me is something I will hold on to and use for the rest of my life. This program truly changed my life and survives as a motivation to give kids the same opportunity. I debated students from around the world such as Taiwan, The United Kingdom, and the Dominican Republic.</p>
    <h4>My national successes include: </h4>
    <p>
        2017 Tournament of Champions Qualifier Public Forum Debate,
        2017 National Forensics Championship,	28th in the nation in Congressional Senate

    <h2>Employment and Internships</h2>
    <h3>Idaho State University / Student IT Technician</h3>
    <p>Since my graduation from High School, I have worked as a student IT technician for Idaho State University. I am tasked with hands on technical service of computer technology around campus along with the upkeep and maintenance of servers and web pages for the College of Science and Engineering here at Idaho State University.</p>
    <h3>School District 25 / Speech and Debate Assistant Coach</h3>
    <p>I was officially hired as a school district employee in July of 2017 in order to carry on the legacy of success and growth that my senior year fostered. Throughout the last 2 years I have worked closely with high school students working on rhetorical approaches to international and domestic issues. I find this employment opportunity to be more than a job, rather, an opportunity to give high school students a chance at an event that truly revolutionized and changed my life for the better. </p>
